# A Wall Following Fire Sensing Robot on V-REP

The project aims at developing an autonomous robot which can detect fire in a room and extinguish it.

The file wall_following_bot.py has the code for a robot which detects an obstacle as a turn and follows the wall.
It is to be used with the files inverse_kinematics.py which uses analytical inverse kinematics to point the arm at the base of a fire.


Read the code for detailed comments and look up the project report for specifics!

# Robotics Project - Manan Mehta

The project aims at developing an autonomous robot which can detect fire in a room and extinguish it.

The file wall_following_bot.py has the code for a robot which detects an obstacle as a turn and follows the wall.
The file xxxxx.py is a work in progress which implements inverse kinematics on the robot arm.

To be added: a file for fire detection and subsequent movement of the robot towards the fire.

Read the code for detailed comments.

Works with V-Rep file Update4.ttt
